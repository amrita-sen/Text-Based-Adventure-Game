# Text-Based-Adventure-Game
This is a text-based adventure game that has a simple interface in which the player types in commands using the keyboard. 
These commands allow the player to move through and search the gaming environment, pick up objects and fight monsters.

Gameplay:
The player explores a maze of rooms picking up weapons to wield against monsters, food and valuables to store in their 
inventory. The player wins if they find the exit and escape the maze. The player loses the game if their health points 
reach 0. The player has health and confidence points which are boosted by eating food or admiring valuables in the 
inventory. Weapons are used to fight monsters and are stored in the inventory. Chests may be found throughout the maze. 
Treasure chests contain valuables and are opened with a key and War chests contain weapons and are opened with a lockpick.
As the player moves between rooms, a monster may attack them. The player must battle the monster by wielding a weapon and 
exchanging attacks until one is defeated. During battle, the player may wield any weapon in their inventory. The player’s 
confidence and wielded weapon determines their attack strength. A monster’s attacks decrease the health and confidence 
points of the player, based on the strength of the monster.
